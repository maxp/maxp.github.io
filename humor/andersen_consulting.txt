
                       - Arthur Andersen -
 
Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the 
edge of a deserted road. Suddenly a brand new "Jeep Cherokee" 
screeches to a halt next to him.

The driver, a young man dressed in a Brioni suit, Cerrutti shoes, 
Ray-Ban glasses, and a YSL tie gets out and asks the shepherd: 
If I guess how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?

The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the sheep which graze 
and says: All right.

The young man parks the car, connects the notebook and the mobile, 
enters a NASA site, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a data base 
and 60 Excel tables filled with algorithms, then prints a 150-pages report 
on his high-tech mini-printer.

He then turns to the shepherd and says: You have exactly 1586 sheep here.
The shepherd answers: That's correct, you can have your sheep. 
The young man takes the sheep and puts in the back of his jeep.

The shepherd looks at him and asks: 
If I guess your profession, will you return my sheep to me?

The young man answers: Yes, why not.

The shepherd says: You are an "Arthur Andersen" consultant!

How did you know? - asks the young man.

Very simple, - answers the shepherd: 
First, you come here without being called. 
Second, you charge me, to tell me something I already knew. 
Third, you do not understand anything about what I do....because you took my dog!!!
